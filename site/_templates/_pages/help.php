		<h2 class="highlight">Uploading and Making Videos:</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="makevideo">How do I make a video?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					For starters you'll need to have a digital camera or some way to create and capture the movies somehow. Then, once you have created a movie of your own you can edit it or add music. We encourage you to edit your videos with software such as Windows MovieMaker (included with every Windows installation), or Apple iMovie. Using these programs you can easily edit your videos, add soundtracks, etc.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>					
		
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="wmm">What is this .MSWMM file? How do I create a movie with Windows Movie Maker?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					A .MSWMM file is a Windows Movie Maker Project file. By saving the project, it allows you to return to the movide and make modifications at a later time. However, if you're satisfied with the movie and would like to upload and share the result through EpikTube, you will need to choose the "Save Movie File" option under the "File" menu (which is different from "Save Project" that creates the .MSWMM file).
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>	
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="howlong">How long do my videos stay on EpikTube?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					Currently, we do not have any time limits or expirations on videos.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="whatkindvideos">What kind of videos can I upload?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					We accept any type of video content as long as it does not contain:
						<ul>
							<li>Pornography or obscene material</li>
							<li>Copyrighted content (unless you own all the necessary rights)</li>
							<li>Hate or graphically violent acts</li>
						</ul>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="videolength">How long can my video be?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					There is no time limit on your video, but the video file you upload must be less than 100 MB in size.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
		
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="videoformats">What video file formats can I upload?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					EpikTube accepts video files from most digital cameras and from cell phones in the .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG file formats. 
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="uploadtime">How long will my video take to upload?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					Depending on your connection speed and the size of the video, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to upload a video. Generally, if you have a high speed internet connection you can expect the upload to take somewhere between 1-5mins for every 1MB, so if your video is 20MB it will probably take between 20 minutes - 1 hour to upload; however, the experience is different for every user because of the variation in connection speeds.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="improve">How can I improve my videos?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					We encourage you to edit your videos with software such as Windows MovieMaker (included with every Windows installation), or Apple iMovie. Using these programs you can easily edit your videos, add soundtracks, etc.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong><a name="uploadlimit">Is there a limit to how much I can upload?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					The only limit is 100MB per video. We don't have any limit for the number of videos you upload, and we don't foresee adding a ceiling anytime in the future. So, get crankin' and upload as many videos as you'd like - its more content for the EpikTube community to enjoy!

					<strong><a name="embedmyspace">How do I embed videos on my MySpace/Friendster profile?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					Please see http://www.epiktube.xyz/sharing for information on how to embed your videos on Friendster/MySpace/eBay/blogs.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>	
				<li>
					<strong><a name="autoplay">Can I make my embedded videos autoplay?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					Yes, you can autoplay movies!
					<br/>
					<br/>
					You know how there's that embeddable source that's shown at the bottom of every video, like: 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.epiktube.xyz/v/OdT9z-JjtJk&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.epiktube.xyz/v/OdT9z-JjtJk&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
				  	<br/>
					<br/>
					Basically, if you append &amp;autoplay=1 so it looks like this:
					<br/>
					&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.epiktube.xyz/v/OdT9z-JjtJk&amp;autoplay=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.epiktube.xyz/v/OdT9z-JjtJk&amp;autoplay=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
				  	<br/>
					<br/>
					That should make the video automatically start playing.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>	
				<li>
					<strong><a name="weightheight">The width and height of the video is appearing when I embed it on myspace. How do I remove this?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					You will need to edit this code that you used to embed your video onto this page.  Once you are in the area where you can edit the code, remove this text from the beginning of the code:
					<br/>
					<br/>
					&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;
				  	<br/>
					<br/>
					Then save the changes and you will find that this is no longer appearing near your video.

					<strong><a name="videosnoplay">Videos won't play, what's wrong?</a></strong>

					Please make sure you have the latest version on Macromedia Flash installed on your computer. To download it, please visit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060412045859/http://www.macromedia.com/" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com</a>

			<ul>	
				<li>
					<strong><a name="videostopping">The video keeps stopping while I'm watching it. How do I fix that?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					If a video doesn't play continuously it may be due to your connection speed. You'll need a broadband connection with at least 500+Kbps for the best viewing experience.
					<br/>
					<a href="#top">top</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ul>	
				<li>
					<strong><a name="noaudio">I can't hear the audio when I'm watching a video, why?</a></strong>
					<br/>
					To make sure that you hear sound while watching videos, please check the volume controls on your computer. Also, be sure to increase the volume on other conventional video players on your computer, such as Real Player or Windows Media. This may have an effect on your computer's master volume levels. Next, check to see if your system meets these requirements for running the Video Viewer:
					
					<br/>
					<br/>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Macromedia Flash Player 7.0+ plug-in</li>
						<li>Windows 2000 or higher with latest updates installed</li>
						<li>Mac OS X 10.3 or higher</li>
						<li>Firefox 1.1+, IE 5.0+, or Safari 1.0+</li>
						<li>Broadband connection with 500+ Kbps</li>
					</ul>
					
					<br/>
					
					If your system meets all the requirements, but the Video Viewer still isn't working properly, please try troubleshooting with a different browser. Also, please test the audio on multiple videos.

					<strong><a name="foreverupload">My video is taking forever to upload. Is something wrong?</a></strong>

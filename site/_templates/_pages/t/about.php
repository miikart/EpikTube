<p>Founded in April 2024, EpikTube is a consumer media company for people to watch and share original videos worldwide through a Web experience. Prior to EpikTube, there was no easy way for individuals to share video on the Web. Dealing with hundreds of multimedia formats, massive file sizes and difficult uploading methods made sharing personal video clips on the Web a daunting task for even the most tech-savvy individual.</p>

<p>With its revolutionary technology, EpikTube has given people the ability to easily, upload, tag and share video clips through epiktube.xyz, across the Internet, and through email as well as to create their own personal video network. With over 25 million videos served up daily and investment support from Sequoia Capital, EpikTube is set to become the Internet's premier video service.</p>
